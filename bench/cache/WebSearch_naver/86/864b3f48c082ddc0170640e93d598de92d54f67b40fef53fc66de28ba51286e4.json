Rising amounts of greenhouse gases are preventing heat radiated from Earth’s surface from escaping into space as freely as it used to. Most of the excess atmospheric heat is passed back to the ocean. As a result, upper ocean heat content has increased significantly over the past few decades. Upper layers are accumulating "

Climate change is the greatest global threat to coral reef ecosystems. Scientific evidence now clearly indicates that the Earth's atmosphere and ocean are warming, and that these changes are primarily due to greenhouse gases derived from human activities.

The global conveyor belt is a strong, but easily disrupted process.  Research suggests that the conveyor belt may be affected by climate  change. If global warming results in increased rainfall in the North  Atlantic, and the melting of glaciers and sea ice, the influx of warm  freshwater onto the sea sur"
